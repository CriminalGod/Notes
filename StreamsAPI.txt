Creating Streams

concat() :
static <T> Stream<T> concat(Stream<? extends T> firstStream, Stream<? extends T> secondStream)

Stream.concat() method is used to merge two streams into one stream which consist of all elements of both merged streams.
This method creates a lazily concatenated stream whose elements are all the elements of the firstStream followed by all the elements of the secondStream.
The resulting stream is ordered if both of the input streams are ordered.
The resulting stream is parallel if either of the input streams is parallel.
When the resulting stream is closed, the close handlers for both input streams are invoked.
